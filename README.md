## a. How much data your publisher program will send to the message broker in one run?

In one run, the publisher program sends five messages to the message broker. Each message contains a user ID and a user name, both as strings. The total data sent depends on the size of these strings and the serialization overhead, but conceptually, it is five serialized UserCreatedEventMessage structs.

## b. The url of: “amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672” is the same as in the subscriber program, what does it mean?

This URL specifies the connection details for the AMQP message broker:

- `amqp` is the protocol (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol).
- The first `guest` is the username.
- The second `guest` is the password.
- `localhost` is the server address (the local machine).
- `5672` is the port number where the broker listens for connections.

When running the publisher, it sends multiple messages in quick succession to the RabbitMQ message broker. This burst of messages causes the message rates chart in the RabbitMQ monitoring interface to spike, reflecting the sudden increase in published messages. The spike visually represents the activity generated by the publisher as it transmits events to the broker.
